# Inception

This project focuses on creating a virtualized multi-service infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose. The goal is to set up and manage containers for different services, all running in isolation but communicating seamlessly with one another within the same network.

Requirements

Use Docker Compose to configure and orchestrate multiple services.
Set up at least three distinct containers, each serving a specific purpose:
* A WordPress container running a CMS (Content Management System).
* A MariaDB container to manage the database for WordPress.
* An NGINX container to act as a reverse proxy and serve the WordPress site.
Ensure proper container isolation while maintaining connectivity between them.
